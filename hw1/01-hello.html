          My name is Taylor Pettingill. I am a Computer Science student and plan
          to graduate at the end of this school year. My favorite place to visit
          is Sweden, which I have been to multiple times. Some of my family
          members live in Stockholm and my mormor (grandmother in Swedish) lives
          in a town called Borl√§nge. I am really excited to learn about web
          development and, in particular, HTML and Javascript.
